- Prepare a plot that shows how the RK4-IP performs relative to the SySSM and SiSSM.

- Use a fundamental soliton and propagate it of one soliton period.
- Assess the endpoint error (global) error for all three algorithms.
- Plot the endpoint errors using a log-log plot (x-axis: stepsize, y-axis: endpoint error).
